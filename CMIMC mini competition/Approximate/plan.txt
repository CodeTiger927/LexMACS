Okay so 2 equations, evaluated from -20 to 20

Real equation:

T_x = (3/4) * e^(0.22x) - 8sqrt(3 * |x|) + 14sin(3x/4 - 2) - |x - 43.2|/3 + 40


Equations you can choose from
Y_x = ax^2.2 + bcos(2x + c) + d/(1 + e^(-x)) + log_(|e| + 1.1)(|x| + 0.1) + f
Tweek the parameters (a,b,c,d,e,f) so that
for each interger point -20 <= x <= 20, sum of |T_x - Y_x| is minimized
